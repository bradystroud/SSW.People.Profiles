Landon is the Multimedia Specialist & Videographer for SSW and SSW TV.

With over 6 years of experience in the film industry, Landon has a strong focus on creative storytelling, backed with a solid technical foundation. He has a keen interest in new technology, and has worked on a number of 360 Video and Virtual Reality projects using bleeding-edge equipment. 

Landon draws on a diverse background including marketing, music, and healthcare to bring unique perspective to his projects. 

Like the rest of the team at SSW, he believes personal growth is something that should always be developed. 

In order to learn something new it's important to try something different - that's why when he's not in the office he's playing with new technology, experimenting with new techniques, or finding new ways to move with capoeira.
